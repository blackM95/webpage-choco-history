        <p class="px-3">The history of chocolate begins in Mesoamerica. Fermented beverages made from chocolate date back to 350 BC.The Aztecs believed that cacao seeds were the gift of Quetzalcoatl, the god of wisdom, and the seeds once had so much
          value that
          they were used as a form of currency. Originally prepared only as a drink, chocolate was served as a bitter, from a liquid, mixed with spices or corn puree. It was believed to have aphrodisiac powers and to give the drinker strength.
          Today, such drinks are also known as "Chilate" and are made by locals in the South of Mexico. After its arrival to Europe in the sixteenth century, sugar was added to it and it became popular throughout society, first among the ruling
          classes and then among the common people. In the 20th century, chocolate was considered essential in the rations of United States soldiers at war.
          The word "chocolate" comes from the Classical Nahuatl word chocolātl, and entered the English language from the Spanish language.</p>

        <p class="px-3">Cultivation, consumption, and cultural use of cacao were extensive in Mesoamerica where the cacao tree is native. When pollinated, the seed of the cacao tree eventually forms a kind of sheath, or ear, 20" long, hanging from
          the tree trunk itself. Within the sheath are 30 to 40 brownish-red almond-shaped beans embedded in a sweet viscous pulp. While the beans themselves are bitter due to the alkaloids within them, the sweet pulp may have been the first element
          consumed by humans.<br>
          Cacao pods themselves can range in a wide range of colors, from pale yellow to bright green, all the way to dark purple or crimson. The skin can also vary greatly - some are sculpted with craters or warts, while others are completely
          smooth. This wide range in type of pods is unique to cacaos in that their color and texture does not necessarily determine the ripeness or taste of the beans inside </p>

        <p class="px-3">Evidence suggests that it may have been fermented and served as an alcoholic beverage as early as 1400 BC. Cultivation of the Cacao was not an easy process. Part of the reason was that was due to the fact that, Cacao trees in
          their natural environment grew up to 60 or more feet tall. When the trees were grown in a plantation however, they grew
          to around 20 feet tall.While researchers do not agree which Mesoamerican culture first domesticated the cacao tree, the use of the fermented bean in a drink seems to have arisen in North America (Mesoamerica—Central America and Mexico).
          Scientists have been able to confirm its presence in vessels around the world by evaluating the "chemical footprint" detectable in the microsamples of contents that remain</p>
